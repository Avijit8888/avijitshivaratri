          Before time had a name, before space unfolded its vast canvas,
          before stars burned or atoms formed,
          there existed a singularity —
          infinite density compressed within infinite silence.
          Science describes it as the beginning of the universe.
          Spiritual wisdom calls it Adi Parashakti —
          the primordial energy.
          All matter, all light, all consciousness
          rested within a boundless point of potential.

          The singularity expanded.
          Space stretched.
          Time began to flow.
          Energy transformed into particles,
          particles into atoms,
          atoms into stars and galaxies.
          Creation was not chaos —
          it was movement from stillness into expression.
          The universe did not explode randomly;
          it unfolded with hidden order.

          Gravity bound stars.
          Light pierced the void.
          Nebulae swirled like breath in motion.
          This dynamic force —
          the pulse that moves galaxies
          and ignites suns —
          is Shakti.
          She is vibration.
          She is transformation.
          She is the living rhythm of existence.

          The silent observer.
          The stillness beneath every vibration.
          The field in which energy dances.
          This eternal witness is Shiva —
          not merely a deity in form,
          but pure consciousness itself.
          Without Shiva, Shakti has no witness.
          Without Shakti, Shiva has no expression.

        <p class="story">
          For creation to exist, unity appeared divided.
          Consciousness and energy seemed separate,
          yet remained eternally one.
          Like space and time.
          Like matter and gravity.
          Like love and longing.
          What separates in form
          remains united in essence.
          Shiva and Shakti
          are not two —
          they are one truth remembering itself.

          From separation arose longing.
          From longing arose devotion.
          Love became the gravity of existence —
          the invisible force bending destiny.
          Just as gravity binds planets to stars,
          love binds consciousness to energy.
          It is not weakness.
          It is the fundamental law of unity.

          Shiva and Shakti are not distant.
          They exist within you —
          as awareness and as energy.
          What is eternal does not end.
          It transforms.
          It returns.
          It remembers.
